🦋 Try It Online: Butterfly Species Identifier (Web Demo)

Want to test the Butterfly Species Identifier without installing or cloning the repo?
You can use the interactive web app hosted on Hugging Face Spaces:

💡 How It Works

Upload a butterfly photo → the model predicts the most likely species.

Get detailed info (Chinese + English name, order, family, genus, wingspan, habitat notes).

Browse trained species in the Species List tab.

Download sample images (provided below the identifier) to quickly test the model.

📷 Example Usage

Drag & drop a butterfly photo (e.g., taken in Hong Kong).

Or use one of the provided sample images.

The model will return top-5 predictions with probabilities, along with species information.

📝 Notes

The web demo uses the trained ResNet50 model (best_model_state.pt).

The model currently supports the species listed above and enriched by species_info.json.

Some species may still display “No info yet” if their metadata has not been added.
